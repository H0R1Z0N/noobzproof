Hide your file in a folder that's hidden with secret registry key of the Windows filesystem (kinda like godmod in Windows), combine with axcrypt 1.X.X legacy to have a perfect hidden stash to protect against underisable intruder like a snooping girlfriend or young kid.

To use, edit in your text editor the following you want to customize first :
-Reference to "NSFW" which can be replaced with "Familly Vacation Picture" or anything, it's the name of the folder when unhidden, please use english quote (those --> ") if you put a space into the name.
-Reference to "9876" which's the default password, it can be anything, but make it a single string of text/number, it's not case sensitive, so lowercase=uppercase and cannot use a space or special character.
Note : Don't change anything else or it will fail to work properly.

Then, the first time you run it, it will create the folder you name instead of NSFW, then to test it to be sure it work, run it again, it should hide itself, then try it again to see if you can unhide it. You can now start storing file inside the folder and hide it everytime your are done.

You can also use something like autohotkey to run the .bat file everytime you press a certain combo or hotkey.

To increase security, use some some per file basis encryption program like the legacy axcrypt 1.X.X with your own unique password. It should protect you against more tech savvy onlooker.

This should protect you mostly from anybody who's not tech savvy enough, even those old windows crownies from the 90'S who are not able to move on to windows 10 or linux and still insist on using Windows 7 in 2019.
